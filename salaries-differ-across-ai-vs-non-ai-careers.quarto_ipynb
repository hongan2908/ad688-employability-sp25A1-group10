Through classification, aggregation, and visualization, we aim to uncover compensation trends across both career paths.\n",

        "The analysis of monthly job postings reveals that Non-AI careers consistently dominate the U.S. job market, averaging around 9,000 postings per month. Despite experiencing a noticeable dip in July, Non-AI job volumes quickly rebounded in August and September, indicating strong demand recovery. In contrast, AI careers maintain a lower volume, typically ranging between 5,000 and 6,000 postings monthly. However, the trend among AI roles appears more stable, with minor fluctuations and a modest recovery following Julyâ€™s decline. This suggests that while fewer in quantity, AI job postings demonstrate resilience and steady momentum in hiring activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the salary trends for AI careers, historical data from May to September 2024 shows moderate fluctuations, with a pronounced dip in August representing the lowest average salary in that period. Using a simple linear regression model, forecasts from October 2024 through March 2025 indicate a gradual decline in average AI salaries. Importantly, this downward trend does not suggest collapse but rather points to a stabilizing market. As AI technologies become more widespread and accessible, the normalization of compensationâ€”paired with a growing supply of skilled candidatesâ€”could be moderating previously inflated salary levels. Despite the projected dip, AI roles remain high-paying and continue to offer strong long-term potential.\n",

        "AI-related careers consistently offer higher salaries, with a mean of $133,344 and median of $130,500, compared to $108,513 and $102,500 respectively for non-AI roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salary variability remains relatively equal across both groups (~$43,000 standard deviation), but AI roles tend to avoid the lower-end salaries more common in non-AI positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The minimum salary for AI careers is substantially higher at $23,585, indicating a stronger baseline earning potential versus $15,860 for non-AI roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximum reported salary is identical across both categories ($500,000), likely reflecting high-level executive or specialized niche roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "AI job postings, while fewer in number, show consistent volume and a stable rebound after a mid-year dip, suggesting continued demand for AI talent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forecasting results predict a gradual decline in AI average salaries over the next six months, indicating potential market stabilization rather than contraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis confirms that AI-related roles provide superior salary outcomes, both in average and median terms, and offer greater compensation stability at the lower end of the spectrum. Despite a projected slight decline in average salaries, AI positions remain highly competitive and rewarding.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings emphasize the value of developing AI-focused skill sets such as machine learning, NLP, and data engineering. For students, job seekers, and educators alike, aligning educational and career strategies with the AI sectorâ€™s continued evolution will be key to unlocking long-term financial and professional success."
