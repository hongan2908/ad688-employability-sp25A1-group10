Addressing these gaps will elevate the team’s capabilities and make them more market-ready.\n\nSQL (Programming Language)\nAlthough the team has intermediate proficiency in SQL, moving towards expert-level understanding is essential. SQL remains one of the most requested skills across IT and data-centric roles. Advanced topics like complex joins, window functions, performance tuning, and writing optimized queries should be covered. Recommended resources include Coursera's SQL for Data Science and DataCamp SQL Career Track.\n\nPython (Programming Language)\nPython is the cornerstone of automation, analytics, and machine learning. The team should focus on advancing their skills beyond basic scripting. This includes learning about data manipulation (Pandas), building small projects, and exploring libraries used in data science or automation. Free resources like the Google Python Crash Course and the IBM Python for Data Science (Coursera) can be leveraged.\n\nSAP Applications\nSAP is currently one of the weakest areas within the team. Enterprise software skills like SAP are critical in corporate environments. Team members should target introductory SAP courses to gain a basic understanding of navigation, reporting, and common SAP modules. Free options like OpenSAP are recommended to start with.\n\nDashboarding Tools (Power BI / Tableau)\nVisual storytelling and data presentation are crucial skills in modern IT roles. As seen in the analysis, there is little to no current exposure to Power BI and Tableau. Training should start with beginner-friendly courses that teach how to create interactive dashboards and perform basic data analysis. Tableau Public and Microsoft Learn for Power BI offer excellent free resources.\n\nMicrosoft Excel\nWhile the team is relatively advanced in Excel, moving towards expert proficiency will unlock greater efficiencies. Topics like VBA macros, Power Query, pivot tables, and advanced formulas should be prioritized. Recommended platforms include LinkedIn Learning and Excel Skills for Business (Coursera).\n\nTableau, Power BI, and Microsoft Office (Missing Skills)\nThe missing ratings for Tableau, Power BI, and Microsoft Office indicate complete lack of knowledge. These tools are essential for reporting, business communication, and project collaboration in IT environments. Each team member should aim to reach at least intermediate level proficiency through self-paced courses and hands-on practice.\n\n#### Suggested Team Learning Plan\nTo close these gaps systematically:\n\nWeekly Learning Sessions: Rotate weekly responsibilities where each member shares what they learned about a specific skill.\n\nPair Learning: Pair up team members with stronger skills (e.g., SQL, Python) to support others.\n\nMicro-Certifications: Encourage completion of short certifications within 4–6 weeks (e.g., Tableau Desktop Specialist, Power BI Fundamentals).\n\nPractical Projects: Apply new skills through internal mock projects like building dashboards or writing Python scripts.\n\nTracking Progress: Regularly assess skill levels every month and update the heatmap to measure progress.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe skill gap analysis clearly highlights the team’s current strengths and opportunities for improvement. While foundational skills like SQL, Python, and Excel are relatively well developed, enterprise tools like SAP, Tableau, and Power BI remain significant blind spots.\n\nBy following the improvement plan and encouraging structured learning, the team will not only close existing gaps but also align with modern IT and data industry expectations. This proactive approach will make the team more versatile, industry-relevant, and ready for advanced career opportunities.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Skill Gap Analysis\n\n\n\nIn this analysis, we evaluate the current skill levels of our team and compare them with industry requirements based on job postings data.
