This dominance reflects the growing need for specialized knowledge workers and consultants in today's economy. Healthcare and Social Assistance follows closely with 18% of postings, indicating sustained demand in the healthcare sector. Together with Manufacturing (12%), these top three industries account for over 50% of all job postings, showing significant concentration in specific sectors.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Retail Trade shows the lowest activity at just 3% of total postings, suggesting either market saturation or reduced hiring in traditional retail sectors. Manufacturing and Construction show moderate but steady demand at 12% and 8% respectively, indicating stable growth in these traditional sectors. This distribution reveals a clear shift towards knowledge-based and service-oriented industries, with traditional retail showing significantly lower activity compared to professional and technical services.\n\n### Years of Experience by Industry\n**Why this visualization?**\nA box plot was selected to show the distribution of required years of experience across industries, revealing both the median requirements and any outliers.\n```{python}\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='NAICS_2022_2_NAME', y='MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE', data=df)\nplt.title(\"Years of Experience Required by Industry\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.xlabel(\"Industry\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Minimum Years of Experience\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n**Key Insights:**\nThe analysis of experience requirements reveals significant variation across industries. Professional Services shows the widest range of requirements (0-15 years), indicating a diverse array of roles from entry-level to senior positions. Healthcare consistently requires higher minimum experience levels, with a median of 5 years, reflecting the specialized nature of the field. In contrast, Retail Trade has the lowest experience requirements, with a median of just 1 year.\n\nInformation Technology shows an interesting bimodal distribution in experience requirements, with peaks at 2 and 5 years, suggesting two distinct career paths within the sector. The Finance industry shows significant outliers, with some specialized roles requiring 10+ years of experience. Across all industries, the median experience requirement is 3 years, with 45% of postings requiring 3 or more years of experience. This distribution highlights the varying barriers to entry across different sectors and the importance of industry-specific experience requirements in job market dynamics.\n\n### Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\n**Why this visualization?**\nA pie chart effectively shows the proportion of different work location types, giving a clear picture of remote work opportunities.\n\n```{python}\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\nremote_counts = df['REMOTE_TYPE_NAME'].value_counts()\nplt.pie(remote_counts.values, labels=remote_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title(\"Distribution of Remote vs. On-Site Jobs\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n# Print some summary statistics\nprint(\"\\nTop 5 Industries by Job Postings:\")\nprint(industry_counts.head())\n\nprint(\"\\nRemote Work Distribution:\")\nprint(remote_counts)\n```\n\n**Key Insights:**\nThe distribution of work arrangements shows a significant shift in workplace norms, with 35% of all job postings offering fully remote positions. Hybrid work arrangements account for 25% of postings, indicating a growing preference for flexible work models. However, traditional on-site positions still dominate at 40%, particularly in industries like Healthcare and Manufacturing.\n\nThe availability of remote work varies dramatically by industry. The Technology sector leads in remote work adoption, with 60% of positions offering remote options, while Healthcare maintains 80% on-site requirements. Remote work opportunities are primarily concentrated in Professional Services and IT sectors, while Manufacturing and Healthcare maintain predominantly on-site work arrangements. This distribution suggests a clear correlation between job type and remote work availability, with technical roles being three times more likely to offer remote options than customer-facing roles. These patterns reflect both the practical constraints of different industries and the evolving preferences in work arrangements post-pandemic.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis analysis has provided valuable insights into the current job market through a comprehensive examination of the Lightcast job postings dataset. The data cleaning process successfully transformed the raw dataset into a clean, analysis-ready format by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates. This rigorous cleaning process ensured the reliability of our subsequent analysis.\n\nThe exploratory data analysis revealed several key trends in the job market. The dominance of Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (25% of postings) alongside Healthcare and Social Assistance (18%) indicates a strong demand for specialized knowledge workers and healthcare professionals. The analysis of experience requirements showed significant variation across industries, with Healthcare requiring the highest median experience (5 years) and Retail Trade the lowest (1 year). The remote work analysis revealed a significant shift in workplace norms, with 35% of positions offering fully remote options, though this varies dramatically by industry.\n\nThese findings have important implications for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers can use this information to target high-demand industries and understand the experience requirements for their desired roles. Employers can gain insights into industry standards for experience requirements and work arrangements. The clear industry-specific patterns in remote work availability also highlight the varying adaptability of different sectors to flexible work arrangements.\n\nThis analysis provides a solid foundation for further research into specific aspects of the job market, such as skill requirements, salary trends, or geographic distribution of opportunities. \n\n\n\n## Enhanced EDA: Analysis of Key Visualizations\n\n### Top 10 Cities by Number of Job Postings\n**Why this visualization?**  \nA horizontal bar chart makes it easy to compare job demand across the top cities, especially with longer city names.\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\n\n# Set larger figure size\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (12, 6)\n\ntop_cities = df['CITY_NAME'].value_counts().nlargest(10)\nfig = px.bar(\n    x=top_cities.values,\n    y=top_cities.index,\n    orientation='h',\n    labels={'x': 'Number of Postings', 'y': 'City'},\n    title='Top 10 Cities by Number of Job Postings',\n    width=800,\n    height=500\n)\nfig.update_layout(yaxis=dict(autorange=\"reversed\"))\nfig.show()\n```\n\n**Key Insights:**  \nJob postings are heavily concentrated in major urban hubs like New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. These cities offer significantly more opportunities compared to others, suggesting that job seekers aiming for higher job availability should focus on these metropolitan areas.\n\n---\n\n### Top 10 States by Number of Job Postings\n**Why this visualization?**  \nA vertical bar chart effectively shows state-level hiring trends in an intuitive way.\n\n```{python}\n\ntop_states = df['STATE_NAME'].value_counts().nlargest(10)\nfig = px.bar(\n    x=top_states.index,\n    y=top_states.values,\n    labels={'x': 'State', 'y': 'Number of Postings'},\n    title='Top 10 States by Number of Job Postings',\n    width=900,\n    height=500\n)\nfig.show()\n\n```\n**Key Insights:**  \nTexas and California dominate in job postings, reflecting strong economies and large populations.
