# Skill Gap Analysis



In this analysis, we evaluate the current skill levels of our team and compare them with industry requirements based on job postings data. This will help identify skill gaps and propose improvement strategies.



## Team Skill Level Data



```{python}

# Import necessary libraries

import pandas as pd

import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



# Create a skills data dictionary

skills_data = {

    "Name": ["Shreya", "An Ly", "Advait", "Ritusri"],

    "Python": [4, 3, 5, 4],

    "SQL": [3, 2, 5, 3],

    "Machine Learning": [3, 4, 2, 3],

    "Cloud Computing": [4, 3, 5, 4]

}



# Create a dataframe

df_skills = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)

df_skills.set_index("Name", inplace=True)

df_skills



#| label: heatmap-skills

#| echo: true



import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt



plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

sns.heatmap(df_skills, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5)

plt.title("Team Skill Levels Heatmap")

plt.show()



#| label: compare-to-industry

#| echo: true



# Assume top skills from Lightcast job postings

industry_skills = {

    "Python": 5,

    "SQL": 5,

    "Machine Learning": 4,

    "Cloud Computing": 4,

    "Docker": 4,

    "AWS": 5

}



# Create industry skill levels DataFrame

df_industry = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(industry_skills, orient='index', columns=['Industry_Required_Level'])

df_industry



```



## 4. Improvement Plan



Based on the comparison between our team's current skill levels and industry expectations, we propose the following improvement plan:



### Skills to Prioritize



- **Docker**: Current proficiency across the team is low; critical for DevOps and cloud deployment roles.

- **AWS**: Needed for cloud engineering, data science, and AI/ML projects.

- **Cloud Computing (Advanced)**: Important for remote computing, big data handling, and SaaS deployments.

- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Required for higher-level AI/ML industry roles.



### Suggested Learning Resources



- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** – Official AWS training or Coursera specialization.

- **Docker for Beginners** – Available on Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.

- **Advanced Machine Learning Specialization** – DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

- **SQL for Data Analysis** – Free courses on Mode Analytics and Kaggle.



### Team Collaboration Plan



- Conduct **weekly workshops**: One team member teaches a skill to others (e.g., Docker basics).

- Organize **pair programming sessions** for practice, focusing on Python and Cloud skills.

- Set **individual learning goals**: Each team member selects at least 2 new skills to improve in the next 8 weeks.
