# Introduction

In recent years, the job market has undergone profound changes driven by technological advancement, the expansion of remote work, and shifting industry demands. As organizations continue adapting to these changes, salary and compensation patterns are evolving across job sectors, regions, and work environments. Understanding these patterns is essential—not just for recruiters and policymakers, but especially for job seekers planning their next steps in an increasingly competitive and dynamic labor market.

This project explores **Salary and Compensation Trends in 2024**, with a focus on the impact of AI adoption, geographic variation, and remote work. Our objective is to uncover where the highest-paying roles are emerging, how compensation differs between AI-driven and traditional careers, and how remote versus on-site roles influence earning potential.

Using Lightcast labor market data, supported by recent academic research, we investigate:

- Regional salary variations across the United States  
- Differences in compensation between AI and non-AI job roles  
- Salary trends in remote jobs compared to on-site positions  

Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and modeling, we aim to deliver actionable insights for students and early-career professionals looking to align their skillsets and job search strategies with evolving salary dynamics.

## Research Rationale

Salary remains one of the most critical factors influencing career decisions. Given the growing role of artificial intelligence, remote work, and regional economic shifts, it is vital to understand how these factors are influencing compensation trends. 

Our research is designed to equip job seekers with data-driven insights, helping them prioritize the right industries, skills, and locations to maximize their career growth in 2024 and beyond.

## Brief Literature Review

Recent studies support the importance of analyzing salary trends:

- Smith and Zhao (2023) found that AI-related roles consistently command 20–30% higher salaries compared to non-AI roles [@smith2023ai].
- Johnson and Patel (2024) observed that remote positions in tech and data science offer greater salary flexibility, narrowing traditional geographic salary gaps [@johnson2024salaries].
- Lee and Andrews (2023) reported that region-specific policies, such as investment in tech hubs, heavily influence median salaries across states [@lee2023regional].

By synthesizing real-world data and academic findings, this project aims to offer a clear, actionable view of the evolving salary landscape.
